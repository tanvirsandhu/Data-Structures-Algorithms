Implemented a Queue ADT and a simple application that operates on the queue by accepting input from stdin and performing the desired operation on the
queue.

Using the first in first out algorithm, the program supports the following commands:
  ADD val -- Which adds a package to the queue
  SERVICE -- Which processes the package at the front of the queue. If no package to process, return Queue Empty
  PRINT -- Which prints all the content in the queue
  LENGTH - Which prints the number of elements contained in the queue
