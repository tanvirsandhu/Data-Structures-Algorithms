Implementation of a List ADT where lists can be created, deleted from, and appended to, and I can find any singular entry, the length of the list and the 
max value of the list.

My application supports the following input commands:
  APPEND val -- Which adds a value to the list
  FIND val -- Which prints the index of the first occurence of the value or (-1 if it is not in the list) and a newline
  DELETE index -- Which deletes the element at the provided index and prints the value removed and a newline
  LENGTH -- Which prints the number of elements contained in the list and a newline
  MAX -- Which prints the index of the greatest integer in the list and a newline
  PRINT -- Which prints all the integers in the list separated by a comma.
