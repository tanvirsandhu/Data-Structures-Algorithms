emma woodhouse handsome clever and rich with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence and had lived nearly twenty one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her
she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate indulgent father and had in consequence of her sister s marriage been mistress of his house from a very early period
her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess who had fallen little short of a mother in affection
sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr. woodhouse s family less as a governess than a friend very fond of both daughters but particularly of emma
between them it was more the intimacy of sisters
even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint and the shadow of authority being now long passed away they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached and emma doing just what she liked highly esteeming miss taylor s judgment but directed chiefly by her own
the real evils indeed of emma s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little too well of herself these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments
the danger however was at present so unperceived that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her
sorrow came a gentle sorrow but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness
miss taylor married
it was miss taylor s loss which first brought grief
it was on the wedding day of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance
the wedding over and the bride people gone her father and herself were left to dine together with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening
her father composed himself to sleep after dinner as usual and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost
the event had every promise of happiness for her friend
mr. weston was a man of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age and pleasant manners and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self denying generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match but it was a black morning s work for her
the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day
she recalled her past kindness the kindness the affection of sixteen years how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood
a large debt of gratitude was owing here but the intercourse of the last seven years the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed isabella s marriage on their being left to each other was yet a dearer tenderer recollection
she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent well informed useful gentle knowing all the ways of the family interested in all its concerns and peculiarly interested in herself in every pleasure every scheme of hers one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault
how was she to bear the change it was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them but emma was aware that great must be the difference between a mrs. weston only half a mile from them and a miss taylor in the house and with all her advantages natural and domestic she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude
she dearly loved her father but he was no companion for her
he could not meet her in conversation rational or playful
the evil of the actual disparity in their ages and mr. woodhouse had not married early was much increased by his constitution and habits for having been a valetudinarian all his life without activity of mind or body he was a much older man in ways than in years and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper his talents could not have recommended him at any time
her sister though comparatively but little removed by matrimony being settled in london only sixteen miles off was much beyond her daily reach and many a long october and november evening must be struggled through at hartfield before christmas brought the next visit from isabella and her husband and their little children to fill the house and give her pleasant society again
highbury the large and populous village almost amounting to a town to which hartfield in spite of its separate lawn and shrubberies and name did really belong afforded her no equals
the woodhouses were first in consequence there
all looked up to them
she had many acquaintance in the place for her father was universally civil but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss taylor for even half a day
it was a melancholy change and emma could not but sigh over it and wish for impossible things till her father awoke and made it necessary to be cheerful
his spirits required support
he was a nervous man easily depressed fond of every body that he was used to and hating to part with them hating change of every kind
matrimony as the origin of change was always disagreeable and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter s marrying nor could ever speak of her but with compassion though it had been entirely a match of affection when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too and from his habits of gentle selfishness and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield
emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to keep him from such thoughts but when tea came it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner poor miss taylor i wish she were here again
what a pity it is that mr. weston ever thought of her
i cannot agree with you papa you know i cannot
mr. weston is such a good humoured pleasant excellent man that he thoroughly deserves a good wife and you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever and bear all my odd humours when she might have a house of her own
a house of her own but where is the advantage of a house of her own
this is three times as large. and you have never any odd humours my dear
how often we shall be going to see them and they coming to see us we shall be always meeting
we must begin we must go and pay wedding visit very soon
my dear how am i to get so far
randalls is such a distance
i could not walk half so far
no papa nobody thought of your walking
we must go in the carriage to be sure
the carriage
but james will not like to put the horses to for such a little way and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit
they are to be put into mr. weston s stable papa
you know we have settled all that already
we talked it all over with mr. weston last night
